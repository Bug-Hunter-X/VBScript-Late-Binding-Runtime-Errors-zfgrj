Error Handling with Early Binding:

Early binding, while requiring more upfront work, significantly reduces runtime errors.  It involves declaring object types explicitly, allowing the compiler to perform type checking and prevent some runtime issues.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Dim objExcel As Object
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Excel is not installed. Some features might be unavailable.", vbExclamation
  Exit Sub
End If
' ... use objExcel ...
Set objExcel = Nothing
```
This revised code uses error handling and includes a more informative message to the user.  Using `On Error Resume Next` handles errors during object creation; if Excel is not available, it alerts the user instead of the script abruptly terminating.  It is also possible to use `On Error GoTo ErrorHandler` for a more structured error handling approach.
